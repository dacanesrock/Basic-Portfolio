# Basic-Portfolio

basic wireframe mostly done
some elements that need work:
	-flexbox on ie
	-main page divs extending to flexbox size unintentionally
	-contact message area size on ie
	-hover styling on portfolio page
	-border size on main navbar (larger than line-height atm)
things to try:
	-organizing navbar as series of <a> elements instead of <ul>
	-rounded edges on all images
	-more universal styling changes
